# SpellChecker
This program uses two of the classes in the Java Collection Framework: HashSet and TreeSet to implement a spell checker.

English words are listed in the file words.txt, one word per line.
To verify that the words on this list are spelled correctly, the software will look them up.
The words are also kept in a set.
